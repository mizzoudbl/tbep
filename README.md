## About

We present a novel web-based bio-informatics tool designed to facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for drug discovery. The tool integrates multi-omics datasets rooted in human genetics and utilizes experimentally validated protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to perform genome-wide analyses of proteins that physically interact with genes responsible for disease phenotypes. A key feature of this tool is its real-time large-scale data processing capability, enabled by its efficient architecture and cloud-based framework. Additionally, the tool incorporates an integrated large language model (LLM) to assist scientists in exploring biological insights from the generated network and multi-omics data. The LLM enhances the interpretation and exploration of complex biological relationships, offering a more interactive and intuitive analysis experience. This integration of multi-omics data, PPI networks, and AI-driven exploration provides a powerful framework for accelerating the discovery of novel drug targets and biomarkers.

## Server Configuration

    ```bash
    # Install essential packages
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install -y git nginx
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    sudo systemctl start nginx

    # Open firewall ports
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' 'Nginx Full(v6)' 'OpenSSH' 'OpenSSH (v6)'
    ```

2. Install docker:

    ```bash
    # Add Docker's official GPG key:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

    # Add Docker APT repository:
    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

    # Install Docker

    # Add user to docker group
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker
    ```

3. Configure nginx:

    ```bash
    # Create a new server block (change filename as per requirement)
    sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/<domain-name>.conf
    # Frontend configuration
    ```

    ```bash
    server {
        listen 80;
        # Can change the hosting link accordingly
        server_name <domain-name>;

        location / {
            # Change the port as per requirement
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    # Backend configuration (change filename as per your requirement)
    sudo vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/<domain-name>.conf
    ```

    ```bash
    server {
        listen 80;
        # Can change the hosting link accordingly
        server_name <domain-name>;

        location / {
            # Change the port as per requirement
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;

        }
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    # Test nginx configuration
    sudo nginx -t

    # Reload nginx
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```

4. Now, follow the [Installation](#installation) steps to setup the project. After the process, configure SSL encryption (for https) using certbot if required.

    ```bash
    # Install certbot
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

    # Obtain SSL certificate 
    # Make sure to change the domain name as per requirement
    sudo certbot --nginx -d <domain-name>
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bhupesh98/tbep.git && cd tbep
    ```

2. Fill environment variables in `.env`, `backend/.env` & `frontend/.env` using [`.env.example`](.env.example), [`backend/.env.example`](https://github.com/bhupesh98/tbep-backend/blob/main/.env.example) & [`frontend/.env.example](https://github.com/bhupesh98/tbep-frontend/blob/main/.env.example) file.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
    ```

> 💡 **NOTE**
> If you are developing this application, then only steps 3 and 4 are required. For production, you can pull the relevant docker images and skip the steps 3 & 4. 

3. *[Only for Developers]* Download the video files if available and place them inside the [`frontend/public/video/`](/frontend/public/video/) folder. As the video files are large, they are not included in the repository or tracked via `git lfs`. You can download the video files from the [gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lPA_F8oyIHQddTmsTEK1VU92WnYp-YD7?usp=sharing) and place them inside the mentioned folder.

4. *[Only for Developers]* Due to some weird css issue when building the frontend container, it is recommended for development (`dev` profile) to build the frontend using the following command before running the docker-compose up command. **This step is not required for deployment.**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    pnpm install # or npm install
    pnpm build # or npm run build
    ```

5. Before starting up the services, match tag of image used in `frontend` service according to domain .Now, docker compose up the services and seed the data in neo4j database container. Keep the database dump inside the [scripts](scripts) folder.

    > 💡 **NOTE**
    > In case, the server doesn't have the dump data. Transfer the files using the following command:
    >
    > ```bash
    > # Transfer files to the server
    > scp -r <source-path> <username>@<server-ip>:<destination-path>
    > ```

    ```bash
    # For development, use
    # docker compose up -d --build --profile dev
    # For production, use
    docker compose up -d --build
    docker exec -it neo4j neo4j-admin database load --from-path=/var/lib/neo4j/import/ tbep
    # Change the username (default username is neo4j) and password
    docker exec -it neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p $NEO4J_PASSWORD "CREATE DATABASE tbep; START DATABASE tbep;"
    ```

    > NOTE: To dump the database for data migration. Use this command:
    >
    > ```bash
    > # First, stop the database
    > docker compose exec -it neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p $NEO4J_PASSWORD "STOP DATABASE tbep;"
    > # Dump the database
    > docker exec -it neo4j neo4j-admin database dump tbep --to-path=/var/lib/neo4j/import/backups
    > ```

6. Once, data is seeded successfully and database is online. Restart the neo4j service.

    ```bash
    docker compose restart neo4j
    ```

7. Load ClickHouse data into the database (if you have `.tsv` backup files):

    - Ensure your `.tsv` files are placed in the [`scripts/data/backup/clickhouse`](./scripts/data/backup/clickhouse/) directory.
    - Ensure all services (including ClickHouse) are already running, as tables are created automatically by the application.

    - Load all tables from the backup:

        ```bash
        docker exec -it clickhouse bash -c '
          for f in /backup/clickhouse/*.tsv; do
            t=$(basename "$f" .tsv)
            clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO $t FORMAT TabSeparated" < "$f"
            echo "Loaded $t from $f"
          done
        '
        ```

    > 💡 **NOTE**  
    > The application will auto-create tables on startup. Ensure the `.tsv` files match the expected schema.
    > For more details on importing/exporting ClickHouse data, see the [ClickHouse Data Export/Import](#clickhouse-data-exportimport) section below.

    > 💡 **NOTE**
    > If you are a developer, you can run use [docker-compose.dev.yml](../docker-compose.dev.yml) file to run the services in development mode. This will allow you to make changes in the code and see the changes reflected in the browser without restarting the services.

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
    ```

For more information of backend and frontend, refer to the respective README files in the [backend](./backend/README.md) and [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directories.

## Importing/Exporting Neo4j Data Dump

1. Export the database dump from the database.

    ```bash
    # Dump the database
    docker exec -it neo4j neo4j-admin database dump --overwrite-destination --to-path=/var/lib/neo4j/import/data/backup tbep 
    ```

  Now, the database dump is available in the [backup](./scripts/data/backup) folder. If there's already a dump file present, it will overwrite it. It's better to rename the existing dump file before exporting the data in case something goes wrong, you do not lose the data. This dump file is now ready to be imported into another database.

2. The database dump can be imported into another database using the following command.

    ```bash
    # First, make the database offline
    docker exec -it neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p $NEO4J_PASSWORD "STOP DATABASE tbep;"
    # Now, you can import the database dump
    docker exec -it neo4j neo4j-admin database load --overwrite-destination --from-path=/var/lib/neo4j/import/data/backup tbep
    # Now, restart the container
    docker compose down neo4j && docker compose up -d neo4j
    # Now, you can start the database
    docker exec -it neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p $NEO4J_PASSWORD "CREATE DATABASE tbep IF NOT EXISTS; START DATABASE tbep;"
    ```

    > 💡 **NOTE**  
    > The above command will overwrite the existing database. If you want to keep the existing database, you can create a new database and import the data into that database and then switch to the new database.

3. For ingesting data into the database, refer to the [Scripts Usage Documentation](./scripts/README.md).

## ClickHouse Data Export/Import

### Exporting ClickHouse Data

To export all ClickHouse tables as `.tsv` files (one file per table):

1. **Run this command inside your ClickHouse container:**  
   (Run on the server)
    ```bash
    docker exec -it clickhouse bash -c '
      mkdir -p /backup/clickhouse
      for t in $(clickhouse-client --query="SHOW TABLES" --format=TabSeparated); do
        clickhouse-client --query="SELECT * FROM $t FORMAT TabSeparated" > /backup/clickhouse/${t}.tsv
        echo "Exported $t to /backup/clickhouse/${t}.tsv"
      done
    '
    ```
    - This will create one `.tsv` file per table in the `/scripts/data/backup/clickhouse` directory (mounted as `/backup/clickhouse` in the container).

2. **Transfer the `.tsv` files to your local machine:**  
   (Run on your local machine)
    ```bash
    scp -P <port> -r <username>@<server-ip>:/path/to/server/scripts/data/backup/clickhouse/*.tsv /path/to/local/backup/
    ```
    - Replace `<port>`, `<username>`, and `<server-ip>` with your server details.

---

### Importing ClickHouse Data

If you have received `.tsv` files for ClickHouse tables (one file per table), follow these steps to load all data into your ClickHouse instance:

1. **Transfer the `.tsv` files to the server**  
   (Run on your local machine)
   Use `scp` or another secure copy method to transfer all `.tsv` files to the server.  
   For example:
   ```bash
   scp -P <port> -r /path/to/local/backup/*.tsv <username>@<server-ip>:/path/to/server/scripts/data/backup/clickhouse/
   ```
   - Replace `<port>`, `<username>`, and `<server-ip>` with your server details.
   - Adjust the destination path as needed to match your server's directory structure.

2. **Ensure the backup directory is mounted in Docker**  
   (Check on the server)
   Your `docker-compose.yml` should include this volume for the ClickHouse service:
   ```yaml
   services:
     clickhouse:
       ...
       volumes:
         - clickhouse-data:/var/lib/clickhouse
         - ./scripts/data/backup:/backup
   ```

3. **Start all services (tables will be auto-created by the app):**  
   (Run on the server)
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Load all tables from the backup**  
   (Run on the server)
   Run this command to import all `.tsv` files from the backup directory:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clickhouse bash -c '
     for f in /backup/clickhouse/*.tsv; do
       t=$(basename "$f" .tsv)
       clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO $t FORMAT TabSeparated" < "$f"
       echo "Loaded $t from $f"
     done
   '
   ```

---

**General Guidelines:**  
- Ensure the `.tsv` files are transferred to the correct directory on the server before running the import command.
- The application will automatically create all required tables on startup.
- The `.tsv` files must match the schema expected by the application.
- If you need to adjust the backup path, update the volume mount and the import command accordingly.
